# AranAI: Real-Time AI Traffic Enforcement System by Team Shield Force for Kaaval Hackathon

# Project Status: Hackathon Prototype (Complete Proof-of-Concept)

# Problem Solved: AI-powered mobile camera solution for real-time traffic violation detection (as per Kaaval Hackathon Problem Statement).

# Value Proposition

The AranAI system (அரண் - Protection/Fortress) transforms the standard mobile camera into a smart, evidence-gathering tool for police enforcement. It delivers a superior enforcement solution by focusing on three core improvements:

Real-time Speed: Shifts detection from slow, manual review to immediate, real-time AI classification.

Tamper-Proof Evidence: Ensures evidence is Timestamped, Geotagged and instantly committed to a Firestore database, providing superior legal integrity.

Automatic Capture: Eliminates the need for constant physical monitoring by providing an Automatic AI Overlay and Capture system.

Solution Screenshots

These images demonstrate the two primary enforcement modes of the AranAI platform.

1. Moving Vehicle Enforcement (AranAI Core)

This is the primary function of the current working prototype.

Purpose: Real-time detection and logging of active traffic rule breaking.

Violations Displayed: No Helmet, Triple Riding, Wrong Way, and Illegal Plate.



2. Digital Chalk: Smart Parking Enforcement (Future Feature)

This illustrates the platform's potential for static vehicle management.

Purpose: Automated monitoring of time-restricted parking zones using LPR and GPS to issue e-challans for overstay violations.


# Features & Simulated Workflow

This prototype demonstrates the critical end-to-end workflow for field officers:

Live AI Overlay: Simulates object detection, displaying dynamic bounding boxes and labels for violations such as No Helmet, Triple Riding, Wrong Way, and Illegal Plate.

Evidence Capture: The large central button triggers the instantaneous capture of all detected violation metadata (time, location, violation type).

Secure Logging: Violation records are instantly committed to a Firebase Firestore database for secure, immutable data storage and instant synchronization.

Real-time Log: A slide-out log provides officers with an immediate, live list of all recently captured evidence for operational review.

Design: The application is optimized with a Mobile-First Design for simple, one-handed operation in the field.

# Technology Stack 

The project is built on a modern, flexible web stack:

Frontend/UI: HTML (index.html), CSS (style.css), and the Tailwind CSS utility framework for rapid, responsive styling.

Core Logic: Vanilla JavaScript (app.js) handles the AI simulation, UI rendering, and user interactions.

Database/Auth: The firestore.js module manages secure authentication and persistence using Firebase Firestore for the evidence log.

Platform: Standard Vanilla JavaScript (ES Modules) for high performance and simple deployment.

# Quick Start (Running the Demo)

Prerequisites

You must run the app via a web server due to the use of ES Modules (import/export in JS files).

# Clone the Repository:

git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)[YOUR_USERNAME]/AranAI.git
cd AranAI


S# erve Locally: Use a tool like Node.js's live-server or Python's built-in simple HTTP server.

# Using Python (accessible at http://localhost:8000)
python -m http.server


# Launch: Open your browser and navigate to the local server address (e.g., http://localhost:8000/index.html).

# Key Interactions

Observe Detections: Watch the dynamic bounding boxes and labels move in the mock video feed.

Capture Evidence: Click the large red and white capture button at the bottom center to record a violation.

View Evidence Log: Check the EVIDENCE LOG section at the bottom to see the new record appear instantly via Firestore.

# Future Scope (Towards Production)

Real AI Implementation: Integrate an actual ML model (e.g., TensorFlow.js or TFLite) to process live video data instead of simulation.

Media Storage: Implement Firebase Storage to securely save the raw image/video frames of the violation.

Advanced Geolocation: Use high-precision device GPS APIs to geotag evidence.

Backend Reporting: Develop a comprehensive administrative dashboard for data analysis and violation trend mapping.
